# PDFCleanser for Windows
Small batch script which deletes meta data from PDFs using [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).
some options might not be necessary but the whole thing should work. not guaranteeing that because of obvious reasons.

# Usage:
- Put your pdf, this script and the exiftool in the same folder and then run the script.

Refer to [exifTool](https://exiftool.org/install.html) on how to install their software


# Why does this exist?
This exists because from aproximately 10 tools I have tried on Windows, none of them had worked properly. So I implemented it myself and it worked
